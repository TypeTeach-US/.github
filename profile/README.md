## 🧭 Overview

**TypeTeach US** is a Mac-native tutor that turns the U.S. keyboard layout into second nature through **structured drills, adaptive lessons, and game-like practice**. It blends **motor memory training**, **ergonomic coaching**, and **real-world typing contexts** (emails, code snippets, essays) so you build a skill that survives outside a practice screen. Instead of “endless random letters,” TypeTeach US teaches **progressive chunks**—rows, columns, word families, punctuation, and number row—then **loops your mistakes** until they’re extinct. A **smart pace engine** watches accuracy, speed, rhythm, and strain signals to decide when to push you forward or slow things down. The result is balanced improvement: **steady WPM gains without wrecking accuracy**—and a typing style you can keep for life.

## ❓ What is TypeTeach US?

**TypeTeach US** is a complete **touch-typing system** focused on the **U.S. ANSI keyboard**. It starts with **home-row anchoring** (ASDF JKL;) and builds outward in **micro-steps**: left/right columns, index-finger reach, top row, bottom row, **number row and symbols** (`~!@#$%^&*()`), then **punctuation** (quotes, brackets, em-/en-dash) and **command-friendly shortcuts** you actually use on macOS. Every lesson has three layers:

1) **Technique layer** – posture, wrist height, elbow angle, hand placement, and the “light touch” needed for speed without fatigue. Micro-prompts nudge you: *float your wrists*, *curl ring fingers*, *breathe and relax shoulders*.

2) **Motor learning layer** – repetition is spaced and **variability-rich**: drills alternate between isolated keys, word chunks, and sentences to prevent brittle learning. The engine measures **latency per finger**, **error clusters**, and **row transitions** to tailor what you see next.

3) **Context layer** – practice uses **real text** that matches your world: emails, product copy, technical prose, code-like patterns, or creative writing. You’ll also learn **editing keystrokes** (⌥←/→, ⌘←/→, ⌘⌫) so your flow includes navigation, not just raw letter entry.

TypeTeach US is deliberately **non-punitive**. Errors are feedback, not failure: the app logs **where** and **why** they happen, immediately serves **targeted micros**, and only advances when accuracy stabilizes. A **Consistency Score** weights your last several runs, so lucky streaks don’t promote you too early. When you return after a break, a **Warm-Up Card** reconstructs your weak links and rebuilds rhythm before timed tests. Over time, you’ll see **plateau breakers**—short interventions that recalibrate technique (e.g., *slow to 85% of top speed and maintain 98% accuracy for two minutes*), unlocking new personal bests without the death-spiral of rushing.

## ℹ️ About TypeTeach US (Deep Dive)

**Ergonomics first.** Speed is worthless if it hurts. TypeTeach US coaches neutral wrists, shoulder drop, monitor height, and **gentle key pressure**. The **Rhythm Meter** encourages even cadence; the **Stability Band** visualizes finger drift; **micro-break cues** arrive when your rhythm data suggests tension.

**Assessment that matters.** Traditional WPM tests punish backspaces; TypeTeach US recognizes real writing. You can **fix mistakes** like you would in life; the report separates *raw speed*, *net speed after edits*, and *clean speed* (no edits) so you can train the dimension you need.

**Symbol & number mastery.** Most tutors ignore the number row and punctuation; this one doesn’t. You’ll cover symbol pairs in **contrast drills** (`[] {}`, `; :`, `' "`, `- – —`) and learn **option-based macOS glyphs** you’ll actually use (e.g., **Option–Hyphen** for en dash, **Shift–Option–Hyphen** for em dash).

**Adaptive engine.** The app watches **finger-specific latencies** (ring and pinky often lag), **hand alternation**, **same-hand burden**, and **bigram transitions**. Struggling with `T`→`Y` or `B`→`,`? The engine injects targeted **bigram ladders** until the gap closes, then cools the pressure.

**Gamified, but honest.** Streaks and achievements exist, but they never nudge you to chase speed at the cost of form. **Coach Mode** can cap speed during form rebuilds, while **Challenge Mode** unlocks time-trials only after your **Consistency Score** is solid.

**Writers & coders welcome.** Choose **practice packs**: *General English*, *Technical Writing*, *Blog/Email*, *Code-like* (balanced symbols and camelCase). Packs keep language natural so rhythm generalizes.

**Privacy & portability.** Your data lives **locally** on your Mac. Export progress as CSV/JSON; print certificates for classroom or HR validation. No accounts, no tracking.

## 🧪 Curriculum Roadmap

1. **Home Row** — anchors, gaze, breathing, light touch.  
2. **Outer Columns** — index reaches, stagger awareness.  
3. **Top Row** — fast transitions without shoulder lift.  
4. **Bottom Row** — pinky/ring strength and travel economy.  
5. **Numbers & Symbols** — pairs, punctuation rhythm, macOS glyphs.  
6. **Navigation & Edits** — ⌥/⌘ navigation, select/delete, smart backspace.  
7. **Applied Practice** — emails, essays, support macros, code-like strings.  
8. **Plateau Breakers** — consistency caps, slow-fast ladders, form resets.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install, pick **U.S. keyboard**, and run a **baseline test**.  
2. Start **Lesson 1** with Coach Mode on; watch the rhythm meter.  
3. Do a **Warm-Up Card** before each new session.  
4. Every third session, run a **2–3 min test**; study the heatmap and accept the suggested review deck.  
5. Once clean at 40–50 WPM, unlock **numbers & symbols**; keep accuracy ≥ 97%.

## 🧠 Power Tips

- If accuracy drops below 96%, **cap your speed** and rebuild cadence.  
- Practice **eyes-up**: glance at hands only to reset posture.  
- Rotate in **Practice Packs** that match your life; skills stick better in context.  
- Use **Review Deck** right before a timed test for sharper results.
